\maketitle

\begin{frame}[fragile]{Testing fragile frame}
  \begin{verbatim}
    Use the provided \vfilleditems environment to create 
    nicely spaced bullet points.

    \begin{vfilleditems}
      \item In my opinion, I like it to have my bullet points
      \item evenly spaced from one another
      \item then few bullet points, are not crammed on 
      the upper part of the slide
    \end{vfilleditems}
    \end{verbatim}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Normal frame}
  This will show how a normal frame looks like
\end{frame}
